In short, all of these are synthetic, and therefore they are flawed. So, I ask:
What exists which cannot be put to words, symbols, or ideas, but affects the human experience?1
Science is an example of a framework grounded in language (i.e., logic) which is (almost by design) insufficient for describing all of existence.</description></item><item><title>reinforcement learning and ethics</title><link>https://airportpeople.github.io/thought/20201220/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Dec 2020 17:02:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://airportpeople.github.io/thought/20201220/</guid><description>introduction In the short film Perfectly Natural, we see a young couple, their new baby, and a simulated reality where the baby interacts with her artificially programmed parents.
