In contrast, I believe music is an example of a framework <em>grounded in something other than language</em> which captures something that cannot be put to words, and nonetheless affects the human experience.</p><h1 id=what-i-hear>what i hear</h1><p>People put music to words, and in my experience, this can happen during one of ___ phases of creation:</p><ol><li>Decision</li><li>Ovulation &mldr; (these can period and forget it)</li><li>Fertilization (or conception)</li><li>Gestation (long time!)</li><li>Birth (there&rsquo;s a lot there)</li><li>Life</li><li>Death</li></ol><p>in each of these phases, we talk about music, but words fail us, but the words fail us in different ways, and those different ways in which words fail us tell us something (maybe) about what music is doing, or something.</p><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p>Even this question must be deceivingly insufficient, and in some way recursively contradictory. In using language to ask the question, we are working within the system for which we are critiquing. So, we could simply be &ldquo;asking the wrong question,&rdquo; or doing the wrong thing by asking a question at all, which then brings us further away from the thing we are trying to do, and so on. <a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></section></article><nav role=navigation class="flex-container bottom-menu"><hr><p><a href=/music>music</a>
