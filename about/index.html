Originally from Arizona, Leon Johnson is a classically-trained violinist and a jazz-inspired multi-instrumentalist who finally found his voice as a post-classical minimalist under the moniker Airport People. Leon found his passion for classical music performance as a violinist in the prestigious International Chamber Ameropa master class program in Prague, Czech Republic. Since then, he has played upright bass for many local jazz combos, electric bass for the indie-rock band Broken Light, and played as a multi-instrumentalist for the indie-folk band The Year of the Hare out of Brooklyn, NY.</p><p>Leon is strongly influenced by contemporary artists such as Ã“lafur Arnalds, Nils Frahm, David Georgos of Memum, and especially Keith Kenniff. As Airport People, Leon attempts to find a cohesive balance between traditional minimalist classical motifs, the syncopated nature of modern jazz (a la The Bad Plus), and the organic rhythmic attributes of electronic music (like Floating Points). He also tries to intentionally incorporate field recordings as a way to communicate aspects of an underlying message which the music itself may not do as well on its own.</p><p>Leon is based out of Indianapolis, Indiana, and he currently working on his second full-length Airport People album, expected to release at the beginning of 2021.</p><h1 id=why>Why</h1><p>In the early 19th century, commercial airlines connected the world in a way it&rsquo;s never been before. Since then, international and domestic airports have been a meeting place for people from all over the world: family, friends, enemies, strangers, co-workers, and colleagues alike. I always found a sort of romanticism in interactions of the people at these meeting places. When family members greet one another for the first time in ages, or when co-workers are escaping the office to travel to a new world, or when individuals are just waiting to get from point A to point B, we are all the same. Everyone is a manifestation of the monist universe.</p><p>I like to think that when we are in an airport, in transition, we are actually in a strange limbo. A limbo where we can all be diluted to our singular shared purpose: get <em>there</em>. Maybe, when we find the same connection outside of this meeting place, we can think of ourselves in the same way; we can think of ourselves as airport people.</p><h1 id=what>What</h1><p>This website is a hub for Leon&rsquo;s music and his philosophy.</p></article><nav role=navigation class="flex-container bottom-menu"><hr><p><a href=/music>music</a>
