It seems to me that any philosophy must start with a consistent set of premises or at least an intuitively sound few axioms to work from.

Originally from Arizona, Leon Johnson is a classically-trained violinist and a jazz-inspired multi-instrumentalist who finally found his voice as a post-classical minimalist under the moniker Airport People. Leon found his passion for classical music performance as a violinist in the prestigious International Chamber Ameropa master class program in Prague, Czech Republic. Since then, he has played upright bass for many local jazz combos, electric bass for the indie-rock band Broken Light, and played as a multi-instrumentalist for the indie-folk band The Year of the Hare out of Brooklyn, NY.</description></item></channel></rss>
